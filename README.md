# State Machine PY
(Work Experience 26/6/2023 to 30/6/2023 at CodeIT Belgrade Serbia)

My program changes traffic light colours.
It includes a function to handle all the states, this function does not block code.

1. Created a function to run code in if statements.
2. Created a table, then changed to a class to hold all the states.
3. Made the state machine non blocking, for the timer event.
